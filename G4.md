## Architectural design
The figure depicts a UML class diagram representing key components of Snoozer. It consists of four primary classes: User, Alarm, Question, and Leaderboard. The User class encapsulates user information such as user ID, username, password, email, phone number, and streak. It also includes methods for setting alarms, answering questions, snoozing, and pinging friends. The Alarm class contains methods for setting alarm time, activation, deactivation, adding questions, and managing friends. The Question class represents trivia questions and provides methods for retrieving question text and checking answers. Lastly, the Leaderboard class tracks user streaks and includes methods for adding/removing users and retrieving top users. Together, these classes form the core functionalities of Snoozer, enabling users to set alarms, answer questions, track streaks, and interact socially with friends.

## System Description: How it Connects All Together

Our architectural design allows Snoozer to track a user’s profile and keep track of their streaks through the Profile table. This, along with the leaderboard, allows the app to provide users an incentive to not snooze their alarm and instead enter the trivia/game from stopping their alarm. The Trivia table stores the questions for this use. For social accountability, Snoozer has a chat system that will likely be managed through an API using textFriend(). Additionally, the entire network of friends in this app will be managed through a Friends table to allow for these communication channels in the first place. Finally, alarms will be added similar to iOS alarms in order to keep the flow of the app intuitive, with all alarms and their specifications stored in a table.
