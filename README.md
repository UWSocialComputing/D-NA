Welcome to Snoozer, made by D&NA! Weâ€™ve created an iOS app to help students revolutionize their morning routines and cultivate healthier habits. The key features of the app are: 

1. Chat Feature to emphasize social accountability in waking up friends
  
2. Trivia Questions to wake your brain up Leaderboards and Streaks to compare on time wake up times
